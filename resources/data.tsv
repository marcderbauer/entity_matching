1|"Hong Kong: Tiananmen anniversary arrests highlight deepening repression
Responding to the arrests of four people for seditious intention and disorderly conduct in Hong Kong ahead of the 34th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown, Amnesty Internationals interim Deputy Regional Director for Research Montse Ferrer said:
The Hong Kong government is once again using colonial-era sedition charges to enable its crackdown on freedom of expression as it attempts to stop people commemorating the horrific events of 4 June 1989.
But the fact that Hongkongers continue to mark the Tiananmen crackdown, despite the ever-growing risks, lays bare the futility of the authorities attempts to enforce silence and obedience.
The Hong Kong governments shameful campaign to stop people marking this anniversary mirrors the censorship of the Chinese central government and is an insult to those killed in the Tiananmen crackdown.
All those arrested simply for exercising their right to freedom of expression should be immediately released, and the Hong Kong police must refrain from targeting others who try to peacefully mark this important anniversary. Commemorating the Tiananmen crackdown is not a crime.
Background
Eight people were detained near Hong Kongs Victoria Park on Saturday 3 June for what police described as displaying protest items loaded with seditious wordings, chanting and committing unlawful acts.
Two of those detained have since been released, but the four arrested for seditious intention and disorderly conduct could face up to two years in prison.
Those arrested include two people who had held aloft pieces of paper saying, personal commemoration, hunger strike for 8964 3.4 seconds (referencing the year, date and anniversary of the crackdown) and holding flowers. Another arrested, an artist, had reportedly chanted, Dont forget June 4! Hong Kong people, dont be afraid of them!
Every year on 4 June since 1990, up to hundreds of thousands of people joined a candlelight vigil in Hong Kongs Victoria Park to remember those killed during the Tiananmen crackdown. They called on the Chinese authorities to reveal the truth about what happened and take accountability for the fatalities. The vigil was banned in 2020 and 2021, ostensibly on Covid-19 grounds.
Last year authorities closed parts of Victoria Park citing potential illegal activities. This year it was unavailable due to the hosting of an outdoor market organized by pro-Beijing groups, including those sponsored by the Chief Executive and former and current members of Chinas National Peoples Congress.
The organizer of the past vigils, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, was forced to disband in September 2021 after coming under increasing pressure since the enactment of Hong Kongs national security law in June 2020. Several of its senior figures, including human rights lawyer Chow Hang-tung, have been prosecuted under inciting subversion charges for their peaceful activism.
The Alliance is one of numerous prominent civil society organizations or political groups forced to close after being targeted by the Hong Kong police on national security grounds.
Every year the vigil in Hong Kong featured a recorded message from the Tiananmen Mothers, family members of those killed, who are still seeking a full government account of the deaths, lawful compensation and investigation of criminal responsibility.
Hundreds ’ possibly thousands ’ of people were killed in and around Beijings Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989 when Chinese troops opened fire on students and workers who had been peacefully calling for political and economic reforms as well as an end to corruption. Tens of thousands were arrested across China in the suppression that followed. Many were charged with counter-revolutionary crimes and served very long prison sentences following unfair trials.
Regularly since 1989, activists in mainland China have been detained and charged with subversion or picking quarrels if they commemorate those who were killed, call for the release of prisoners or criticize government actions during the Tiananmen crackdown.

2|"Police detain 23 people in Hong Kong on Tiananmen anniversary
HONG KONG/TAIPEI, June 4 (Reuters) - Hong Kong police said they detained 23 people on Sunday for ""breaching public peace"" and arrested a 53-year-old woman for ""obstructing police officers"" as authorities ramped up security for the 34th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.
Restrictions in Hong Kong have stifled what were once the largest vigils marking the anniversary of the bloody crackdown by Chinese troops on pro-democracy demonstrators, leaving cities like Taipei, London, New York and Berlin to keep the memory of June 4 alive.
Near Victoria Park, the previous site of yearly vigils, hundreds of police conducted stop and search operations, and deployed armoured vehicles and police vans.
Reuters witnesses saw more than a dozen people taken away, including activist Alexandra Wong, 67, who carried a bouquet of flowers, a man who held a copy of ""35th of May"", a play on the Tiananmen crackdown, and an elderly man standing alone on a street corner with a candle.
""The regime wants you to forget, but you can't forget... It (China) wants to whitewash all history,"" said Chris To, 51, who visited the park in a black t-shirt and was searched by police.
""We need to use our bodies and word of mouth to tell others what happened.""
Police on Monday said officers took away 11 men and 12 women aged between 20 and 74 who were suspected of ""breaching the public peace at the scene"".
Hong Kong activists say such police action is part of a broader campaign by China to crush dissent in the city that was promised continued freedoms for 50 years under a ""one country, two systems"" model when Britain handed it back in 1997.
Security is significantly tighter across Hong Kong this year, with up to 6,000 police deployed, including riot and anti-terrorism officers, according to local media.
Senior officials have warned people to abide by the law, but have refused to clarify if such commemoration activities are illegal under a national security law China imposed on Hong Kong in 2020 after sometimes violent mass pro-democracy protests.
In a statement, police said some had been arrested for seditious intent and for ""breaching public peace"".
The United Nations said on Monday it was ""alarmed"" by detentions in Hong Kong.
In Beijing, Tiananmen Square was thronged with tourists taking pictures under the watchful eyes of police and other personnel but with no obvious sign of stepped-up security.
A group of relatives called the Tiananmen Mothers said the anguish never ended.
""Though 34 years have passed, for us, family members of those killed, the pain of losing our loved ones in that one night has tormented us to this day,"" the group said in a statement released by the New York-based watchdog Human Rights in China.
'CLEAR CONCLUSION'
Despite the warnings in Hong Kong, some individuals, including book shop owners, have been quietly marking June 4.
Jailed Hong Kong activist Chow Hang-tung, one of the leaders of a group called The Alliance, which used to organise the June 4 vigils, said on Facebook that she would hold a 34-hour hunger strike.
In mainland China, any mention of the Tiananmen Square crackdown - where troops opened fire on pro-democracy protesters, killing hundreds if not thousands, according to rights groups - is taboo and the subject is heavily censored.
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, when asked about the government's response to events around the world to mark the anniversary, said in Beijing on Friday that the government had already come to a ""clear conclusion about the political turmoil in the late 1980s"".
In democratically governed Taiwan, the last remaining part of the Chinese-speaking world where the anniversary can be marked freely, hundreds attended a memorial at Taipei's Liberty Square where a ""Pillar of Shame"" statue was displayed.
Peggy Kwan, 57, an interpreter at the event, expressed sadness at the stifling of commemorations in Hong Kong.
""Hong Kong is moving backward,"" she said.
China claims Taiwan as its own and has not renounced the use of force to ensure eventual unification. Taiwan Vice President William Lai, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's presidential candidate in an election next January, wrote on his Facebook page that the memory of what happened in Beijing in 1989 must be preserved.
""The event commemorating June 4 has continued to be held in Taipei, which shows that democracy and authoritarianism are the biggest differences between Taiwan and China,"" he said.
In Sydney, one of more than 30 places in North America, Europe and Asia hosting commemoration events, dozens of demonstrators rallied at the Town Hall, chanting ""free Hong Kong"" while holding up placards and yellow umbrellas, the symbol of pro-democracy protests since 2014.

3|"Israeli forces kill 2 Palestinians who carried out attack, army says
NABLUS, West Bank, July 7 (Reuters) - Israeli security forces on Friday killed two Palestinians who carried out a shooting attack against police this week, Israel's military said.
Israeli forces raided the occupied West Bank town of Nablus, the military said, and ""both terrorists were killed following an exchange of fire.""
The official Palestinian news agency WAFA said Israeli troops had cordoned off a house where the two had holed up and that they had been ""executed.""
The armed wing of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a major faction in the Palestine Liberation Organization, claimed the two men as members and said they had carried out the attack on Israeli police.
In a separate incident near the city of Ramallah, a member of the Hamas Islamist group was killed by Israeli fire when violence erupted at an anti-settlement protest, Hamas said. Palestinian residents said Jewish settlers arrived and a stone-throwing clash ensued.
The Israeli army said Palestinian rioters had hurled rocks at troops and at a main road. The troops ""responded with riot dispersal means and live fire, a hit was identified.""
Most countries view Israels settlements on occupied land as illegal. Israel disputes this.
Friday's violence followed a two-day Israeli operation earlier this week in the densely populated Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank, which has been a flashpoint in a wave of Israeli-Palestinian violence that has convulsed the West Bank for more than a year.
The Israeli military said it had targeted infrastructure and weapons depots of Palestinian militant factions in Jenin in the operation.
Twelve Palestinians, most confirmed as militant fighters, were killed and around 100 wounded in the incursion that began with late-night drone strikes, followed by a sweep involving more than 1,000 troops.
The raid damaged homes, left a trail of wrecked streets and burned-out cars and prompted the evacuation of thousands of people from the refugee camp. Israel says all the Palestinians killed were combatants. One Israeli soldier was killed.
The Jenin operation was the most intense in two decades, said the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) that provides public services in Gaza and the West Bank.
UNRWA said it had set up a temporary healthcare facility because a part its health centre was destroyed, and appealed for foreign aid to help rebuild damaged buildings.
The Israeli army during its operation had said it struck a militant command center in Jenin that was situated next to an UNRWA school and medical centre.
